#AR Maze Game

##Summary

Sample mazes which were drawn and designed got projected on a real world surface which is where the game would be played. Mazes were drawn by hand and then designed on Unity using 3D rectangular objects. These 3D rectangular objects were aligned using a pseudo-graph that was drawn as a set of 3D cubes spaced out 1 inch apart from each other. Vuforia was the plug-in used to project 3D game objects onto the real-world using the laptop's front-facing camera. The image of a Pokemon Sun logo found online was used as a flag to project the game on and the ds box containing the image would be the surface where the game would be projected on.

There were scenarios where the ball would be stuck and the rectangular objects holding the maze together would nee
